# My projects

As a Software Engineering student, I have worked on many projects in my classes. Below are the links to two projects I've enjoyed working on.

## SER225 Game

I worked on this project for my SER225 class. My team and I were given a basic game designed by Alexander Thimineur; our goal was to add more features to it. I liked this project because we could do anything we wanted and use our imagination and creativity. Click [here](https://github.com/etimarky/TeamA4) for a link to the gitHub repository.

## GitHub Interface

For this class, I have worked with my team during module 9 to build a mini interface with the basic git command (push, pull, commit). I thought it was cool to be able to recreate some of GitHub's features on an interface that we designed.
