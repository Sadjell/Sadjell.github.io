# About Me

![Image of Myself](./master/myself2.jpeg)

My name is Sadjell Mamon. I am a junior Software Engineering major at Quinnipiac University. I am from Haiti and I speak three languages (French, Creole, and English).

I was a Finance major at first, but I did not like it. I felt the need to explore and decided to switch my major to Software Engineering. I think it was a great decision because I am liking it so far.
